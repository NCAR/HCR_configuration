Running the HCR apps
====================

1. Logging in
-------------

The 'hcr' account is used on both archiver and hcrdrx.

Both machines are accessible via a router on the UCAR guest network.

The router IP address is 128.117.47.230.

The DNS-supplied name is radar-router.guest.ucar.edu.

To log in to archiver:

  ssh -XY hcr@radar-router.guest.ucar.edu

From there you can log in to hcrdrx.

To log in to hcrdrx directly, use

  ssh -XY -p 23 hcr@radar-router.guest.ucar.edu

2. Web page
-----------

The main web page is:

  http://radar-router.guest.ucar.edu

There are links to the SysView monitoring page, and how-to docs,
including this one.

3. Running apps on hcrdrx
--------------------------

The 'hcrdrx' app runs on the hcrdrx host.

(a) To start the system, run

  start_all

Type 'ppm' to see the apps which are running.

(b) To monitor the log file for hcrdrx in real-time, run

  check_log.hcrdrx

(c) To stop the system, run

  stop_all

(d) To run hcrdrx by hand and watch the output, do

  stop_all
  cd
  cd projDir/hcrdrx/params
  hcrdrx hcrdrx.ops

4. Running apps on archiver
---------------------------

The bulk of the system runs on archiver.

(a) To start the system up, run

  start_all

Type 'ppm' to see the apps which are running.

Type 'pcheck' to make sure all required processes are running.

(b) CfRadial data files

The CfRadial files from Iq2Dsr and Dsr2Radx are stored in:

  projDir/data/cfradial/moments/wband

(c) To stop the system, run

  stop_all

(d) To run HawkEye (using the simulated angles), run

  start_HawkEye.wband

(e) To run tcpscope, run

  start_tcpscope.wband

(f) Restart Iq2Dsr after changing params

  restart_Iq2Dsr.wband

(g) To run the bscan display (using DDS):

  cd
  cd workspace/hcr/src/hcrbscan
  ./hcrbscan

(h) To run the hcr archiver (using DDS):

  cd
  cd workspace/hcr/src/hcrarchiver
  ./hcrarchiver

The CfRadial files from hcrarchiver are stored in:

  /data_first
