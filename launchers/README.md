# README for launchers

This directory contains small `.desktop` launcher files which enable execution of various programs used for HCR via desktop icons. They are simple text files, and the ones provided here are reasonably generic. However, directions for how and where to install the files vary among Gnome versions and among Linux distributions, so you will likely need the Web to serve as your guide for those details.

Note that icons for the launchers are provided in the `icons` directory, and the launchers provided assume that the icons will be available explicitly in the `/home/hcr/git/HCR_configuration/launcher/icons` directory.
